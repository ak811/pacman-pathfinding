# Simulation of Pac-Man as a Learning Agent

<br>

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simulation of the Pac-Man game. The simulation utilizes various search algorithms such as A*, BFS, DFS and UCS to control the movement and locate the optimal path for the Pac-Man character. Heuristics are also integrated to enhance the search algorithms and make the gameplay more efficient. Additionally, the project incorporates elements of reinforcement learning to allow the Pac-Man agent to learn from its experiences and improve its performance over time. The ultimate objective of the project is to showcase how search algorithms and RL can be employed to create intelligent agents capable of tackling complex challenges. The project utilizes the Pygame library to provide the graphical display and user interactions for the simulation.
